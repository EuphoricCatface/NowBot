# NowBot

An euphoria.io bot to educate you about timezones. Based on CylonicRaider/basebot

The bot answers with the image on the comic [xkcd 1335:Now](http://xkcd.com.now/) on `!now` command.
The library this bot is based upon is [basebot](https://github.com/CylonicRaider/basebot).

To be implemented:
* show localtime along with timezone
* move over the user:timezone list from the original bot (make it a machine-readable list like json, xml or whatnot)
 * Please open an issue if you know appropriate terminology for this^. Thank you!
* show timezone for each user
* automatic registration
