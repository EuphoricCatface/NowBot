# NowBot

An euphoria.io bot to educate you about timezones. Based on CylonicRaider/basebot

The bot answers with the image on the comic [xkcd 1335:Now](http://xkcd.com.now/) on `!now` command.
The library this bot is based upon is [basebot](https://github.com/CylonicRaider/basebot).

To be implemented:
- [x] show localtime along with timezone
- [ ] show timezone for each user
- [ ] move over the user:timezone dictionary from the original bot (make it a machine-readable list like json, xml or whatnot)
 - Please open an issue if you know appropriate terminology for this^. Thank you!
- [ ] automatic registration
